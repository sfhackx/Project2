## Management App for Household Donation Pickups

New Hope Incorporated, an organization that provides support to domestic abuse victims collects donated household goods as a way to raise fund.  Their fleet of trucks need to be monitored and fully utilized for available pickups, so they can collect as many donations as possible.

### Requirements

1. All trucks have their own records in Salesforce with location information and an email address.
2. A map page is needed to show all truck locations in real time.
3. A pickup record, which has the location of the donation, can be inserted then matched to the closest truck.  Once matched a notification email is sent to the truck (which has connection and console display to the driver for pickup).
4. (Bonus) Create an IoT simulation app on Heroku that can send location info to truck records in Salesforce
